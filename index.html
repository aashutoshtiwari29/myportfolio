                    This isn’t just a portfolio—it’s a reflection of my journey so far.  
                    I know you may not have the whole day to go through every detail, so I’ve done my best to keep things short, honest, and meaningful.  
                    Of course, no single page can truly capture a person’s entire story—but I’ve tried to include the parts that matter the most.  
                    Each section here carries something real—my experiences, challenges, lessons, and personal growth.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, just so you know—this entire website has been made by me (Ashutosh Tiwari) using only HTML and CSS.  
                    I did most of the work myself, and where I needed clarity or ideas, I used ChatGPT for suggestions. That collaboration shaped the final result you're seeing now.

                <h5 class="intro-main">
                    I’ve divided my portfolio into four sections to make it easier for you to explore:  
                    <b>“About Me,” “My Academic Excellence,” “Significant Achievements and Awards,”</b> and <b>“My Hobbies.”</b>  
                    I’d recommend viewing them in that order—but the rest is your choice.
